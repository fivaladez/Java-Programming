/*
Inheritance
Inheritance can be defined as the process where one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another.
 With the use of inheritance the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order.

The class which inherits the properties of other is known as subclass (derived class, child class)
and the class whose properties are inherited is known as superclass (base class, parent class).

extends Keyword
extends is the keyword used to inherit the properties of a class.

Note âˆ’ A subclass inherits all the members (fields, methods, and nested classes) from its superclass.
Constructors are not members, so they are not inherited by subclasses, but the constructor of the
superclass can be invoked from the subclass.

The super keyword
The super keyword is similar to this keyword. Following are the scenarios where the super keyword is used.
It is used to differentiate the members of superclass from the members of subclass, if they have same names.
It is used to invoke the superclass constructor from subclass.

Invoking Superclass Constructor
If a class is inheriting the properties of another class, the subclass automatically acquires the
default constructor of the superclass. But if you want to call a parameterized constructor of the
superclass, you need to use the super keyword.
